# Introduction
Hey there, my name is Hannah ([She/Her](https://en.pronouns.page/@Lost167)), but I also go by Lost online, and I am a Programmer Analyst graduate from NBCC (2021-2023). 

I would still consider myself a somewhat *newer* developer who mainly sticks to what I'm most comfortable with like Web Applications (Vanilla and Node JavaScript, and a bit of PHP), but I do want to branch out and become better at using languages I am not as good at like Java and C#!

---

I have many ideas I want to put to code as soon as I get the chance such as:
- [ ] A 2D RPG (details are still WIP, will update)
- [ ] Minecraft Create Mod Addon (with a focus on adding more/better miners and quarries)
