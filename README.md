# Introduction
Hiya! I am Lost (I use [She/They](https://en.pronouns.page/@Lost167) pronouns), I'm currently a full-time Programmer Analyst Student (est. 2023)! I am a *newer* developer, mainly sticking to working with Web Applications (Vanilla JS, nodeJS and PHP7.4)

I have many ideas I want to put to code as soon as I get the chance such as:
- [ ] Pokemon Scarlet/Violet Isolated Encounters Map (React app) with [@sh0ckR6](https://github.com/sh0ckR6)
- [ ] Pokemon Shiny Tracker (React app + Mobile app connectivity)
- [ ]
